			<h3>GoToobs</h3>
			<div class="float-section float-right">
				<span class="image-wrapper"><img src="/assets//images/photos/products.gotoobs.jpg" /></span>
			</div>
			<p>GoToobs are the perfect tubes for traveling, outdoors and more. All GoToobs are approved for airplane carry-on, they're food-safe (FDA) and are 100% BPA-free and PC-free. Why do we like these tubes? They are easy to fill because of the large opening and easy to squeeze because they are made from soft yet rugged silicone. The collar of the tube even has a little window that rotates so you can choose a label to indicate the tube's contents—soap, lotion, and more.</p>
			<p>What will you put in your GoToob—shampoo, sunscreen, your favorite Oribe product, or maybe even your BBQ sauce?! We carry the 1.25, 2.0 and 3.0 fluid ounce sizes.</p>
