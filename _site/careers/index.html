	<h4>Full-Time Independent Contractor</h4>
	<p>Ready to take the next steps in your career? Considering your option to be an Independent Contractor or move your business to a new space? If a chair at Soncy is a consideration for you to serve your clients and be apart of a beautifully enjoyable and creative workday; come by, let’s explore the possibilities.</p>

	<h4>Part-time Contractor</h4>
	<p>This is an innovative, exciting opportunity for an Independent Contractor to share workspace with another independently contracted hairdresser. This means you would co-op the use of a chair - working out your booking schedule between the two hairdressers. There are many benefits to this concept, one being shared rental expense, which helps everyone! (Your clients will love being Soncy with you!) If you have the desire to lower your overhead, are fair-minded and responsible, willing to be flexible, and are interested in joining a collaborative and fun-loving group. Soncy embodies the details of a "work hard/play hard" theory &ndash; come check us out, we’d love to meet you.</p>
