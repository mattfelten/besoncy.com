					<p>For more than 3 decades, I have made my love of people and beautiful hair my focus. I have been inspired by, trained with, and worked alongside many industry notables. I keep my approach to the art of hair simple and healthy &mdash; I strive for a balanced blend of classics and current trends. Because it is important to me that clients have hair they can manage on their own, I work with them to develop home-care plans and skills for recreating their Soncy looks every day. I believe hair is a permanent accessory, to be enjoyed! I suggest you do the best you can with it&hellip; play with the texture and have fun, style after style, color after color (as long as you keep it healthy).</p>
					<p>As the owner of Soncy, I am proud that our team of hairdressers is full of heart and talent. Several of them have been my amazing assistants and it is exciting to see them grow professionally &mdash; as my intention is to do my best setting them up for success in this ever changing industry. It is a way for me to give back to an industry that has given me so much. In a way, it is honoring so many that have generously "held me up," mentoring me throughout my career.</p>

					<p>I have been in the industry for almost 10 years, and come with an approach to hair that incorporates creativity, collaboration, and ease. My biggest love of hair comes from working with clients to give them looks that enhance their own assets and attributes, as well as giving them a relaxing and enjoyable Soncy experience. I have also been fortunate enough to receive training from industry greats such as Orlando Pita, Kien Hoang, and Ronnie Stam; and am well-versed in Wella, Schwartzkopf, and Oribe. A true "hair nerd", my favorite part is the blow dry - I love the freedom and the artistry that styling brings. Getting to work with some of my favorite hairdressers every day inspires and motivates me, not only professionally, but personally.</p>
					<p>I also love laughing, Game of Thrones, Laker basketball, Oribe's Thick texture spray, and riding my bike to the beach.</p>

				<li class="bio">
					<p>I have been a hairstylist for 10 years and I could not be happier to call this my profession. I love my job mostly because I get to make every person that sits in my chair feel and look their best. Everything from the consultation to the blow dry I feel is very important. We can decide together what you want and make it happen. I have been lucky enough to have training from Paul Mitchell, Vidal Sassoon, Schwartzkopf Professional and many others. I love education because I believe keeping up on the latest trends in this industry is a must. I have worked in the Newport/Laguna Beach area for 8 years specializing in coloring and cutting. Although if I had to choose one thing in hair to be my most favorite it would have to be blow drying and styling after a big change. The smile you get to see after that is priceless.</p>
					<p>Aside from doing hair some of the things I love are yoga, sushi, girls nights with my best friends, my maltipoo Jax, family time and exploring new restaurants and wine bars with my boyfriend.</p>

					<p>My love for this industry started as a young girl in elementary school, when I can remember looking at my teachers and thinking how pretty they were. Their hair was always so perfect, their makeup was simple but elegant at the same time; always so put together. I strive to be as put together as they were every day of my life, in my own way. I always knew I wanted to assist right out of school instead of getting my own chair, so I could learn as much I could before moving forward. My ultimate goal in life is to pay it forward, to make men and women feel beautiful,,and better about themselves when they leave my chair. (In my opinion, the best gift you can give someone!) I'm excited to see myself grow, and continue to learn everyday from the best people.</p>

					<p>Some of my favorite things to do : trying new restaurants, Netflix marathons, and spending quality time with my family.</p>

					<p>Since 2010 I have hit the ground running in this wonderful industry. Education has been the backbone to my career, I am able to be confident in my service with the knowledge I have obtained from Paul Mitchell, Vidal Sassoon and numerous classes from different product lines. With that I am able to provide fitting and personalized haircuts and colors to each one of my clients. I have fully submerged myself in a salon atmosphere and truly enjoy the creative process of stepping outside of the box with a style that is still realistic. Absolute best feeling in the world is a satisfied client, I make it my goal to keep anyone in my chair happy from the first cut of hair to the last round brushed section. Happiness in my chair is happiness in my life.</p>

					<p>Other than hair, I am an ocean loving, dog adoring, cider drinking, desert camping, sports junkie.</p>

				<li class="bio">
					<p>I have been working in this amazing industry for 8 years, having a wonderful time exploring all that it has to offer!  Beyond being a salon stylist, I have worked on fashion, editorial, and music events, as well as private session styling. I am certified in extension work for the ultimate makeover, and have extensive wedding/special event styling experience. I have been trained in Paul Mitchell Systems, Redken, Schwartzkopf Professional, Oribe Hair Care, as well as many other lines.</p>

					<p>Since 2007, I have been an educator at Paul Mitchell where I have held several exclusive titles, such as -Cutting Specialist, Texture and Styling Specialist, Admissions Advisor, and Education Leader. I'm extremely passionate about education whether in the academy, or educating my clients at Soncy. I love to teach each guest how to work with their hair to design a style that I have uniquely customized for them! I definitely enjoy styling and creating precision cuts, although my true passion is color - specifically blonding and color corrections. I live for my client’s smiles after a "hair project"! Feel free to schedule some time with me so we can chat about any and all of your hair questions!</p>

					<p>Aside from my "hair life", I love reading, cooking with my husband, participating in the Avon Breast Cancer Walk each year, crafting with my girlfriends, and traveling!</p>

				<li class="bio">
					<p>I see hair as an art form and I remember my first experience seeing a platform artist at work on stage. At that moment it sparked my interest in the beauty industry.</p>

					<p>I love creating something from nothing. Enhancing the appearance of my clients whether it's a simple haircut, make-up, or creative color, I see each client as a blank canvas for me to paint and create.</p>

					<p>I pride myself on always being current with what’s happening in trend, fashion, hair, and make-up. I do this by attending educational classes and conventions as much as I can. "I believe the day we stop learning is the day we stop growing"</p>

					<p>I also enjoy offering make-up to my clients to complete their look. I still get excited every time my client and I collaborate on a look that is complimentary to their personal style and needs.</p>

					<p>I stay connected to fashion and Hollywood by continuing my work as a freelance artist on photo shoots, red carpet, HBO, and television. By request my services are always available for on location.</p>

					<p>With all that said most of all I am a passionate artist awaiting my next canvas and looking forward to being inspired by each client I encounter and hopes to create my next piece of art. </p>
