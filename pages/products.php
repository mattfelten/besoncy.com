			<span class="image alignright"><img src="/lib/images/photos/products.oribe.jpg" /></span>
			<p>With over 30 years of styling heritage at the top of the editorial and salon worlds with old-world craftsmanship and cutting-edge innovation from the most sought-after beauty artisans, the Oribe line delivers the highest possible levels of performance and sophistication. Oribe offers a collection of paraben-free shampoos, conditioners and masques with UV protection, and styling products (e.g., oils, creams, gels, sprays) that employ the latest advancements in hold, luster and volume.</p>	
			<p>Wow, that's a mouthful and quite honestly, a lot of "marketing speak." Put more simply, we sell Oribe products because "it works" and they last (that makes you a smart shopper). Some of our customers' favorite Oribe products include:</p>

			<h3>GoToobs</h3>
			<span class="image alignright"><img src="/lib/images/photos/products.gotoobs.jpg" /></span>
			<p>GoToobs are the perfect tubes for traveling, outdoors and more. All GoToobs are approved for airplane carry-on, they're food-safe (FDA) and are 100% BPA-free and PC-free. Why do we like these tubes? They are easy to fill because of the large opening and easy to squeeze because they are made from soft yet rugged silicone. The collar of the tube even has a little window that rotates so you can choose a label to indicate the tube's contents—soap, lotion, and more.</p>
			<p>What will you put in your GoToob—shampoo, sunscreen, your favorite Oribe product, or maybe even your BBQ sauce?! We carry the 1.25, 2.0 and 3.0 fluid ounce sizes.</p>
