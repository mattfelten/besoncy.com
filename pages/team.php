		<p>At Soncy, we are a supportive and collaborative team of hairdressers. It is our intention to create an enviroment where everyone (clients and hairdressers) is encouraged to be their best selves. To further our professional development and inspire each other, we meet regularly as a team to discuss new ideas, and trends.</p>
		<p>We regularly host cut, color and styling classes at Soncy during which we learn new innovative techniques. We are often invited to attend industry events to enhance our relationships and creative work. We get the opportunity to experience talented educators as well as the varied applications of the products we use and sell at the space. We think you will agree that we take our craft and your experience very seriously, without taking ourselves too serious.</p>

					<p>For more than 3 decades, I have made my love of people and beautiful hair my focus. I have been inspired by, trained with, and worked alongside many industry notables. I keep my approach to the art of hair simple and healthy--I strike a balanced blend of classics and current trends.  Because it is important to me that clients have hair styles they can manage on their own, I work with them to develop home-care plans and skills for recreating their Soncy looks every day.  Hair is a permanent accessory, enjoy it!  Do the best you can with it...play and have fun, style after style, color after color.</p>
					<p>As the owner of Soncy, I am proud that my team of hairdressers is full of heart and talent.  Several of them have been my amazing assistants and it is exciting to see them grow professionally. Being a mentor to a new generation of hairdressers is a challenge I really enjoy. It is a way for me to give back to an industry that has given me so much. In a way, it is honoring so many that have generously “held me up”, mentoring me throughout my career.</p>

					<p>Passion. Laughter. Hair. Art. Music. Creativity. Dance. There you have it! These are the seven words that describe me in a nut shell. Not only do I love doing short haircuts and creative color but I also love to get in my PJ&rsquo;s, throw on the latest Disney movie, and pop some popcorn. I like to shake it (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;dance&rdquo; for you older folks), paint a picture, laugh at new jokes, and make people feel beautiful.</p>
					<p>Education is very important to me and I believe the mind continues to grow as we acquire new knowledge. I am also light hearted and always on the go. I guess you could say I like to be busy (and I like things organized). My love and passion for the music business keeps me super busy around the edges of doing great hair using my skills and learning new ones at my internship. Having had the opportunity to go on tour last summer I am excitedly anticipating some more summer festivals.</p>

					<p>H-e-l-l-o ! Since the beginning of my career seven years ago, I have been determined to provide each of my clients with beautiful hair. I believe that beauty comes from within and I love bringing out your inner beauty by working with you to choose a cut, color and style that highlights your best features, reflects who you are, and makes you feel special. I thoroughly enjoy what I do and am thrilled when a new person is sitting in my chair because I know that there will be one more beautiful head of hair out there in the world.</p>
					<p>I am also committed to keeping my skills sharp and up- to-date by attending classes and events in the industry. I am excited when I learn something new and can't wait to share it with my co-workers (and you). I love classic looks and work hard to ensure that your hair looks good not only on the day I have you in my chair but also the weeks in-between your hair appointments. Say goodbye to bad hair days!</p>

					<p>I have been in the industry for over seven years, and come with an approach to hair that incorporates creativity, collaboration, and ease. My biggest love of hair comes from working with clients to give them looks that enhance their own assets and attributes. I have also been fortunate enough to receive training from industry greats such as Orlando Pita and Ronnie Stam; and am well-versed in Wella, Schwartzkopf, Keratin by Coppola, and Oribe. A true "hair nerd", my favorite part is the blow dry - I love the freedom and the artistry that styling brings. Working alongside some of my favorite hairdressers every day inspires and motivates me, not only professionally, but personally.</p>
					<p>I also love laughing, pop culture, music & movies, family & friends, my iPhone 4, Oribe's Soft Lacquer heat styling spray, spinning, and Diet Coke (not in that order).</p>

					<p>The first time I expressed an interest in hair I was eight years old&mdash;I cut my own hair! At about age fifteen I started doing my friends&rsquo; hair and was hooked. From that point on I loved designing hair. I have been known to create interesting and innovative styles for both myself and my friends. I have experimented with color, curls, bangs and layers. Although I have always loved hair, it wasn&rsquo;t until May of 2011 that I attained my cosmetology license. Now I am planning my future and have dreams of doing runway, barbering, creating my own product line and even owning my own space.</p>
					<p>Yes, I have lofty goals but I think of myself as goal oriented, creative and adventurous and know that if I push myself I can succeed. While I can be intense when it comes to achieving my goals I am also very tranquil. I believe in love, honesty and respect; I enjoy meeting new people and keeping my family and friends close.</p>
