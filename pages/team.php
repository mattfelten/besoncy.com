		<p>At Soncy, we are a supportive and collaborative team of hairdressers. It is our intention to create an enviroment where everyone (clients and hairdressers) is encouraged to be their best selves. To further our professional development and inspire each other, we meet regularly as a team to discuss new ideas, and trends.</p>
		<p>We regularly host cut, color and styling classes at Soncy during which we learn new innovative techniques. We are often invited to attend industry events to enhance our relationships and creative work. We get the opportunity to experience talented educators as well as the varied applications of the products we use and sell at the space. We think you will agree that we take our craft and your experience very seriously, without taking ourselves too serious.</p>

					<p>For more than 3 decades, I have made my love of people and beautiful hair my focus. I have been inspired by, trained with, and worked alongside many industry notables. I keep my approach to the art of hair simple and healthy--I strike a balanced blend of classics and current trends.  Because it is important to me that clients have hair styles they can manage on their own, I work with them to develop home-care plans and skills for recreating their Soncy looks every day.  Hair is a permanent accessory, enjoy it!  Do the best you can with it...play and have fun, style after style, color after color.</p>
					<p>As the owner of Soncy, I am proud that my team of hairdressers is full of heart and talent.  Several of them have been my amazing assistants and it is exciting to see them grow professionally. Being a mentor to a new generation of hairdressers is a challenge I really enjoy. It is a way for me to give back to an industry that has given me so much. In a way, it is honoring so many that have generously “held me up”, mentoring me throughout my career.</p>

					<p>Say goodbye to bad hair days! I love pretty color, flirty layers, classic looks (with new twists) and work hard to ensure that your hair looks and feels amazing not only on the day I have you in my chair but also the weeks in-between your hair appointments. To that end, (not the split ones) I keep my creative skills sharp and up-to-date by attending a variety of classes and events in my exciting and ever changing industry. It inspires me to learn something new and can't wait to share it with my co-workers (and you).</p>
					<p>I also believe that beauty comes from within and I enjoy bringing out your inner beauty by first listening to you as I work with you designing a cut, color and style that highlights your best features, reflects who you are, and makes you feel special. I am thoroughly fulfilled with what I do and am thrilled when a new person is sitting in my chair because I know that there will be one more beautiful head of hair and satisfied Soncy guest out there in the world.</p>

				<li class="bio">
					<p>I have been in the industry for over seven years, and come with an approach to hair that incorporates creativity, collaboration, and ease. My biggest love of hair comes from working with clients to give them looks that enhance their own assets and attributes. I have also been fortunate enough to receive training from industry greats such as Orlando Pita and Ronnie Stam; and am well-versed in Wella, Schwartzkopf, Keratin by Coppola, and Oribe. A true "hair nerd", my favorite part is the blow dry - I love the freedom and the artistry that styling brings. Working alongside some of my favorite hairdressers every day inspires and motivates me, not only professionally, but personally.</p>
					<p>I also love laughing, pop culture, music & movies, family & friends, my iPhone 4, Oribe's Soft Lacquer heat styling spray, spinning, and Diet Coke (not in that order).</p>

				<li class="bio">
					<p>Organization, planning and being active are my virtues and take over every aspect of my life. My organization craziness ranges from my personal life (including my color coded closet) to my professional life. I can’t function without it. I also love to plan things in order to bring people together and to keep myself active. I enjoy interacting with people, which is why family and friends are a big part of my life. Being Space Coordinator taps into every one of my virtues and also brings new and exciting ways of implementing them. I am always up for new challenges and being able to use what I already know in new and creative ways.</p>
					<p>I also love education, family and friends, my boyfriend, my dog, going to the gym, music, reading and living life to its fullest!</p>

					<p>I am new to this artful industry of hairdressing and I cannot wait to see what the future holds, I am open to learn and share!</p>

					<p>As an assistant and new talent, I am refining my skills, learning new ones and exercising my passion, dedication and creativity at Soncy with this great team.</p>

					<p>Hair has always been my passion and I am (finally) following my dream. Having stepped way from a career in technology, I am inspired everyday by all things around me, especially &hellip; H A I R!  Color and styling (fabulous finish work) are amongst my favorite skills. Inspired by classic and retro hairstyles with a twist of the new, my excitement grows to get even more creative with hair. Seeing that smile on a clients face when they look in the mirror in admiration of their new finished look is such a priceless moment for me and there is no other feeling I’ve experienced like it.</p>

					<p>A lot of my inspiration also comes from my personal interests which include music, movies, and art.</p>

					<p>I am loving my introduction to Oribe's fabulous product line, it is awesome to work with and my new favorite, as I am a self professed hair product junkie!</p>

					<p>The future is bright for me and I am here to embrace it &mdash; one head of hair at a time!</p>
