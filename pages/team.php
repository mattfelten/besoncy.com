		<p>At Soncy, we are a supportive and collaborative team of hairdressers. It is our intention to create an enviroment where everyone (clients and hairdressers) is encouraged to be their best selves. To further our professional development and inspire each other, we meet regularly as a team to discuss new ideas, and trends.</p>
		<p>We regularly host cut, color and styling workshops at Soncy during which we learn new innovative techniques. We are often invited to attend industry events to enhance our relationships and creative work. We get the opportunity to experience talented educators as well as the varied applications of the products we use and sell at the space. We think you will agree that we take our craft and your experience very seriously, without taking ourselves too serious.</p>

					<p>For more than 3 decades, I have made my love of people and beautiful hair my focus. I have been inspired by, trained with, and worked alongside many industry notables. I keep my approach to the art of hair simple and healthy &mdash; I strive for a balanced blend of classics and current trends. Because it is important to me that clients have hair they can manage on their own, I work with them to develop home-care plans and skills for recreating their Soncy looks every day. I believe hair is a permanent accessory, to be enjoyed! I suggest you do the best you can with it&hellip; play with the texture and have fun, style after style, color after color (as long as you keep it healthy).</p>
					<p>As the owner of Soncy, I am proud that our team of hairdressers is full of heart and talent. Several of them have been my amazing assistants and it is exciting to see them grow professionally &mdash; as my intention is to do my best setting them up for success in this ever changing industry. It is a way for me to give back to an industry that has given me so much. In a way, it is honoring so many that have generously "held me up," mentoring me throughout my career.</p>

					<p>I have been in the industry for almost 10 years, and come with an approach to hair that incorporates creativity, collaboration, and ease. My biggest love of hair comes from working with clients to give them looks that enhance their own assets and attributes, as well as giving them a relaxing and enjoyable Soncy experience. I have also been fortunate enough to receive training from industry greats such as Orlando Pita, Kien Hoang, and Ronnie Stam; and am well-versed in Wella, Schwartzkopf, and Oribe. A true "hair nerd", my favorite part is the blow dry - I love the freedom and the artistry that styling brings. Getting to work with some of my favorite hairdressers every day inspires and motivates me, not only professionally, but personally.</p>
					<p>I also love laughing, Game of Thrones, Laker basketball, Oribe's Thick texture spray, and riding my bike to the beach.</p>

				<li class="bio">
					<p>Since graduating from the Paul Mitchell Academy, I've earned a wealth of knowledge from around the World.</p>

					<p>I've worked in the industry for 11 years and have dedicated my professional life to hair and makeup gaining international experience as a stylist in the industry.</p>

					<p>After designing hair for countless weddings in the Napa Valley and Sonoma County, I relocated to Italy where I worked for a year before landing a job at a top London salon learning the technique of dry carving - pioneered by the late John Sahag. I've now returned to California, basing myself at Soncy. You can come to visit me for regular in salon appointments and, I'm fully set up to do hair on location at your wedding, graduation or special event of your choice.</p>

					<p>My passion for the industry ensures that each person is treated as an individual and receives a bespoke service, second to none! Whether it is a cut and style, blow dry, updo, makeup, color or hair extensions - I'll find a style and service that suits you to enhance your natural beauty and features.</p>

					<p>In my time away from the salon I spend it nurturing other passions such as spending time with my fianc&eacute; and our two little dogs. Cooking and hosting friends and family is also another important favorite of mine. I love traveling and experiencing new things and meeting new people.</p>

						<p>There's nothing like a cut with magic to it. See, when you go there, you create new shapes. And it's in carving new shapes that you find the unique shape that matches the soul&mdash;the cheekiness, the naughtiness.</p>
