		<p>At Soncy, we are a supportive and collaborative team of hairdressers. It is our intention to create an enviroment where everyone (clients and hairdressers) is encouraged to be their best selves. To further our professional development and inspire each other, we meet regularly as a team to discuss new ideas, and trends.</p>
		<p>We regularly host cut, color and styling workshops at Soncy during which we learn new innovative techniques. We are often invited to attend industry events to enhance our relationships and creative work. We get the opportunity to experience talented educators as well as the varied applications of the products we use and sell at the space. We think you will agree that we take our craft and your experience very seriously, without taking ourselves too serious.</p>

					<p>For more than 3 decades, I have made my love of people and beautiful hair my focus. I have been inspired by, trained with, and worked alongside many industry notables. I keep my approach to the art of hair simple and healthy &mdash; I strive for a balanced blend of classics and current trends. Because it is important to me that clients have hair they can manage on their own, I work with them to develop home-care plans and skills for recreating their Soncy looks every day. I believe hair is a permanent accessory, to be enjoyed! I suggest you do the best you can with it&hellip; play with the texture and have fun, style after style, color after color (as long as you keep it healthy).</p>
					<p>As the owner of Soncy, I am proud that my team of hairdressers is full of heart and talent. Several of them have been my amazing assistants and it is exciting to see them grow professionally. Being a mentor to a new generation of hairdressers is a challenge I enjoy &mdash; as it is my intention to do my best to set them up for success in this ever changing industry. It is a way for me to give back to an industry that has given me so much. In a way, it is honoring so many that have generously "held me up," mentoring me throughout my career.</p>

					<p>Say goodbye to bad hair days! I love pretty color, flirty layers, classic looks (with new twists) and work hard to ensure that your hair looks and feels amazing not only on the day I have you in my chair but also the weeks in-between your hair appointments. To that end, (not the split ones) I keep my creative skills sharp and up-to-date by attending a variety of workshops and events in my exciting and ever changing industry. It inspires me to learn something new and can't wait to share it with my co-workers (and you).</p>
					<p>I also believe that beauty comes from within and I enjoy bringing out your inner beauty by first listening to you as I work with you designing a cut, color and style that highlights your best features, reflects who you are, and makes you feel special. I am thoroughly fulfilled with what I do and am thrilled when a new person is sitting in my chair because I know that there will be one more beautiful head of hair and satisfied Soncy guest out there in the world.</p>

					<p>I have been in the industry for almost 10 years, and come with an approach to hair that incorporates creativity, collaboration, and ease. My biggest love of hair comes from working with clients to give them looks that enhance their own assets and attributes, as well as giving them a relaxing and enjoyable Soncy experience. I have also been fortunate enough to receive training from industry greats such as Orlando Pita, Kien Hoang, and Ronnie Stam; and am well-versed in Wella, Schwartzkopf, and Oribe. A true "hair nerd", my favorite part is the blow dry - I love the freedom and the artistry that styling brings. Getting to work with some of my favorite hairdressers every day inspires and motivates me, not only professionally, but personally.</p>
					<p>I also love laughing, Game of Thrones, Laker basketball, Oribe's Thick texture spray, and riding my bike to the beach.</p>

					<p>I grew up in salons with my hairdresser mother &mdash; to me, hair is just home! I love creating looks that appear effortless and wear easily, looks that are really tailored to you. A graduate of Vidal Sassoon Academy, I was lucky enough to be trained by and rub elbows with some of this industry's greatest heavy-hitters who really laid down the foundation for building strong technical skills. I love natural hair textures, and my experience apprenticing in precision cutting is informed by this. Every moment is an opportunity to grow and learn, especially in such a rapidly changing industry. I strive to begin each day with enthusiasm, bringing creativity and passion to my craft.</p>

					<p>Outside of the salon I enjoy cooking, reading quirky novels, gawking at old Hollywood film sirens, watching Seinfeld (while I mouth the lines along in concentrated silence), and running into clients unexpectedly and seeing that their hair still looks amazing.</p>
