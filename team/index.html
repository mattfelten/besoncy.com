		<p>At Soncy, we are a supportive and collaborative team of hairdressers. It is our intention to create an enviroment where everyone (clients and hairdressers) is encouraged to be their best selves. To further our professional development and inspire each other, we meet regularly as a team to discuss new ideas, and trends.</p>
		<p>We regularly host cut, color and styling workshops at Soncy during which we learn new innovative techniques. We are often invited to attend industry events to enhance our relationships and creative work. We get the opportunity to experience talented educators as well as the varied applications of the products we use and sell at the space. We think you will agree that we take our craft and your experience very seriously, without taking ourselves too serious.</p>

					<p>I've always had a fascination with the beauty industry. Whether it was sneaking away to cut my bangs as a little girl or helping my friends get ready for our show choir competitions, I've always had my mind on hair!</p>
					<p>As a young stylist, I find that there is always something new to learn and that is what I love about this job! I strive to have my clients on trend while still keeping their looks timeless. I love building relationships with everyone that sits in my chair and enhancing their natural beauty. Here is a glimpse at some of my starting prices: </p>

					<p>Other than obsessing over hair, I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends, going dancing, listening to all kinds of music and taking my pup, Randall, to the dog park! </p>

					<p>I have been in the industry for almost 10 years, and come with an approach to hair that incorporates creativity, collaboration, and ease. My biggest love of hair comes from working with clients to give them looks that enhance their own assets and attributes, as well as giving them a relaxing and enjoyable Soncy experience. I have also been fortunate enough to receive training from industry greats such as Orlando Pita, Kien Hoang, and Ronnie Stam; and am well-versed in Wella, Schwartzkopf, and Oribe. A true "hair nerd", my favorite part is the blow dry - I love the freedom and the artistry that styling brings. Getting to work with some of my favorite hairdressers every day inspires and motivates me, not only professionally, but personally.</p>
					<p>I also love laughing, Game of Thrones, Laker basketball, Oribe's Thick texture spray, and riding my bike to the beach.</p>

					<p>I have been a hairstylist for 10 years and I could not be happier to call this my profession. I love my job mostly because I get to make every person that sits in my chair feel and look their best. Everything from the consultation to the blow dry I feel is very important. We can decide together what you want and make it happen. I have been lucky enough to have training from Paul Mitchell, Vidal Sassoon, Schwartzkopf Professional and many others. I love education because I believe keeping up on the latest trends in this industry is a must. I have worked in the Newport/Laguna Beach area for 8 years specializing in coloring and cutting. Although if I had to choose one thing in hair to be my most favorite it would have to be blow drying and styling after a big change. The smile you get to see after that is priceless.</p>
					<p>Aside from doing hair some of the things I love are yoga, sushi, girls nights with my best friends, my maltipoo Jax, family time and exploring new restaurants and wine bars with my boyfriend.</p>

					<p>I have been working in this amazing industry for 8 years, having a wonderful time exploring all that it has to offer!  Beyond being a salon stylist, I have worked on fashion, editorial, and music events, as well as private session styling. I am certified in extension work for the ultimate makeover, and have extensive wedding/special event styling experience. I have been trained in Paul Mitchell Systems, Redken, Schwartzkopf Professional, Oribe Hair Care, as well as many other lines.</p>

					<p>Since 2007, I have been an educator at Paul Mitchell where I have held several exclusive titles, such as -Cutting Specialist, Texture and Styling Specialist, Admissions Advisor, and Education Leader. I'm extremely passionate about education whether in the academy, or educating my clients at Soncy. I love to teach each guest how to work with their hair to design a style that I have uniquely customized for them! I definitely enjoy styling and creating precision cuts, although my true passion is color - specifically blonding and color corrections. I live for my client’s smiles after a "hair project"! Feel free to schedule some time with me so we can chat about any and all of your hair questions!</p>

					<p>Aside from my "hair life", I love reading, cooking with my husband, participating in the Avon Breast Cancer Walk each year, crafting with my girlfriends, and traveling!</p>

					<p>I see hair as an art form and I remember my first experience seeing a platform artist at work on stage. At that moment it sparked my interest in the beauty industry.</p>

					<p>I love creating something from nothing. Enhancing the appearance of my clients whether it's a simple haircut, make-up, or creative color, I see each client as a blank canvas for me to paint and create.</p>

					<p>I pride myself on always being current with what’s happening in trend, fashion, hair, and make-up. I do this by attending educational classes and conventions as much as I can. "I believe the day we stop learning is the day we stop growing"</p>

					<p>I also enjoy offering make-up to my clients to complete their look. I still get excited every time my client and I collaborate on a look that is complimentary to their personal style and needs.</p>

					<p>I stay connected to fashion and Hollywood by continuing my work as a freelance artist on photo shoots, red carpet, HBO, and television. By request my services are always available for on location.</p>

					<p>With all that said most of all I am a passionate artist awaiting my next canvas and looking forward to being inspired by each client I encounter and hopes to create my next piece of art. </p>
