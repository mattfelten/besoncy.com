		<p>At Soncy, we are a supportive and collaborative team of hairdressers. It is our intention to create an enviroment where everyone (clients and hairdressers) is encouraged to be their best selves. To further our professional development and inspire each other, we meet regularly as a team to discuss new ideas, and trends.</p>
		<p>We regularly host cut, color and styling workshops at Soncy during which we learn new innovative techniques. We are often invited to attend industry events to enhance our relationships and creative work. We get the opportunity to experience talented educators as well as the varied applications of the products we use and sell at the space. We think you will agree that we take our craft and your experience very seriously, without taking ourselves too serious.</p>

					<p>For more than 3 decades, I have made my love of people and beautiful hair my focus. I have been inspired by, trained with, and worked alongside many industry notables. I keep my approach to the art of hair simple and healthy &mdash; I strive for a balanced blend of classics and current trends. Because it is important to me that clients have hair they can manage on their own, I work with them to develop home-care plans and skills for recreating their Soncy looks every day. I believe hair is a permanent accessory, to be enjoyed! I suggest you do the best you can with it&hellip; play with the texture and have fun, style after style, color after color (as long as you keep it healthy).</p>
					<p>As the owner of Soncy, I am proud that our team of hairdressers is full of heart and talent. Several of them have been my amazing assistants and it is exciting to see them grow professionally &mdash; as my intention is to do my best setting them up for success in this ever changing industry. It is a way for me to give back to an industry that has given me so much. In a way, it is honoring so many that have generously "held me up," mentoring me throughout my career.</p>

					<p>I have been in the industry for almost 10 years, and come with an approach to hair that incorporates creativity, collaboration, and ease. My biggest love of hair comes from working with clients to give them looks that enhance their own assets and attributes, as well as giving them a relaxing and enjoyable Soncy experience. I have also been fortunate enough to receive training from industry greats such as Orlando Pita, Kien Hoang, and Ronnie Stam; and am well-versed in Wella, Schwartzkopf, and Oribe. A true "hair nerd", my favorite part is the blow dry - I love the freedom and the artistry that styling brings. Getting to work with some of my favorite hairdressers every day inspires and motivates me, not only professionally, but personally.</p>
					<p>I also love laughing, Game of Thrones, Laker basketball, Oribe's Thick texture spray, and riding my bike to the beach.</p>

					<p>I have been a hairstylist for 10 years and I could not be happier to call this my profession. I love my job mostly because I get to make every person that sits in my chair feel and look their best. Everything from the consultation to the blow dry I feel is very important. We can decide together what you want and make it happen. I have been lucky enough to have training from Paul Mitchell, Vidal Sassoon, Schwartzkopf Professional and many others. I love education because I believe keeping up on the latest trends in this industry is a must. I have worked in the Newport/Laguna Beach area for 8 years specializing in coloring and cutting. Although if I had to choose one thing in hair to be my most favorite it would have to be blow drying and styling after a big change. The smile you get to see after that is priceless.</p>
					<p>Aside from doing hair some of the things I love are yoga, sushi, girls nights with my best friends, my maltipoo Jax, family time and exploring new restaurants and wine bars with my boyfriend.</p>

				<li class="bio">
					<p>Since 2010 I have hit the ground running in this wonderful industry. Education has been the backbone to my career, I am able to be confident in my service with the knowledge I have obtained from Paul Mitchell, Vidal Sassoon and numerous classes from different product lines. With that I am able to provide fitting and personalized haircuts and colors to each one of my clients. I have fully submerged myself in a salon atmosphere and truly enjoy the creative process of stepping outside of the box with a style that is still realistic. Absolute best feeling in the world is a satisfied client, I make it my goal to keep anyone in my chair happy from the first cut of hair to the last round brushed section. Happiness in my chair is happiness in my life.</p>

					<p>Other than hair, I am an ocean loving, dog adoring, cider drinking, desert camping, sports junkie.</p>
