	<h2>Credits</h2>
	<p>I'd like to extend my heart-felt gratitude to a fabulous collaboration of people that have been there for me through this amazing web design process.</p>

	<div class="content">
		<p>Beth Manke aka editor-at-large who assisted me with the somewhat daunting task of writing, proofing and layout of the copy and content for our amazing <a href="http://besoncy.com">www.besoncy.com</a> I couldn't have done it with as much ease without your unwavering support encouraging me through the many obstacles and learning opportunities throughout this project!</p>

		<p><a href="http://ajleonephotography.wordpress.com/">A.J. Leone</a>, for the stunning photos that capture not only the beauty of our space, but the essence of it as well as the sparkle in the Soncy ladies eyes....check out A.J.'s talented eye behind the lens, a hobby turned interest, photography!

		<p>Right after opening the effervescent and generous <a href="http://jeanniemutrais.com/">Jeannie Mutrais</a> came into Soncy for her appointment when before we knew it she was busting out an excitable impromptu space photo shoot. Watching her move with passion throughout was like watching a dance with her and her camera. Within days, the most lovely presented CD of her glimpse showed up as a visual gift. Can't wait to schedule Jeannie in for real.....so talented, thank you!!!</p>

		<p>And then there is <a href="http://arkitect.org">Matt Felten</a>, the most humble and super talented, professional web designer I could have ever hoped to meet and work with! Matt not only created this amazing Soncy site but he exceeded all of my expectations on all levels, one being a 2 week start to finish deadline. He is a man in my experience that listens, has wonderful energy, communication style, design skill, talent and ideas that made the project effortless. We like to say at Soncy, "the best is yet to be"....what will be Matt's next addition to what is already be-yond!</p>

		<p>It goes without saying the continued heart-felt support of all the creative talent at Soncy, who make going to work, doing what we love to do a joyful dream come true!</p>
