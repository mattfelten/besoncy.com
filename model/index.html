	<p>Okay, we don't mean Supermodel as in Kate Moss or Heidi Klum. What we have in mind is much less intimidating and you don't have to starve yourself! As part of our ongoing professional development we often host or attend cutting, coloring, and styling workshops. To attend these workshops we must bring hair models (we much prefer live heads to doll heads). Hair models get complimentary services like haircuts, color highlights, and conditioning treatments.</p>
	<p>Models must be willing to spend on average 4-6 hours with us at workshop (patience is a virtue and we treasure it). We need a diverse group of models to draw from as our workshops often call for different lengths and textures of hair. If you are interested in serving as a hair model <a href="{{base}}/contact/">fill out our contact form</a> or send us a message on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/besoncy">Facebook</a> (and attach a photo if possible) or come by the space so we can put you on our call list.</p>
